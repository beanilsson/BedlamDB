## Tired of duplicate keys? Forgetting your passwords all the time? Do you want to store data the way you want, and not having someone else telling you how to do it?

# Welcome to BedlamDB!
A, very, simple database. The only constraint being that the data is saved within curly braces. But within these braces, you can store any type of data you want! You can even store the same data multiple 
times. Isn't that marvellous? 

Be careful though, there is no security whatsoever implemented. So, maybe don'Ãt store your most prized possessions in BedlamDB.

This database was written and tested only in Visual Studio on a Win10 machine up until v0.0.2. For all versions thereafter, I've used Ubuntu Server 18.10 environment for testing and developing, using g++ as my build tool. So if it would work somewhere else, consider it luck. Shouldn't it work, well, there you have it.

## Binaries
`.exe` binaries can be found under the [releases](https://github.com/beanilsson/BedlamDB/releases) tab. The source code can also be downloaded as `.zip` and `tar.gz`.
